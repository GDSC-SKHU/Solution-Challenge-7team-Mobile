### Why app’s name is **Ppigcycle?**

When you scan a barcode, you will hear a Ppig sound. The Ppig sound represents the cycle of recycling through barcode scanning.

 First, please sign up for an account. The sign-up page includes fields for ID, nickname, password, password confirmation, and the day of the week for recycling. The button next to the ID field is for checking the availability of the ID, and the button next to the nickname field is for checking the availability of the nickname. The last field is for entering the day of the week that corresponds to your recycling schedule. In Korea, recycling days vary for each household, so it is important to enter the correct day.
